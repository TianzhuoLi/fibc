I am studying in the Department of Business Administration at the Macau University of Science and Technology, and have been exposed to courses related to economics and business since high school. And participated in multiple business competitions to achieve results. Due to my love for business competitions, I founded the business competition organization SCBC with friends in 2020. And jointly organize a business competition with FE fabc (Iron Future). The most recent one was the 2023 SCBC X Iron Future Vitality Reboot Race. Here are some of my honors and experiences in organizing competitions
